    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I work in the tax controversy industry where I leverage my deep knowledge of the Internal Revenue Code, strong analytical and negotiation skills, and a commitment to due process to fairly, independently, and impartially resolve tax disputes between taxpayers and the government to avoid litigation. I handle a wide range of cases—anywhere from a few thousand dollars involving individuals to multi-million-dollar tax controversies spanning multiple, interrelated entities with complex fact patterns. </p>
    
    <p>To broaden my future prospects, I am currently training as a full-stack developer. I am excited about opportunities to apply this emerging skill set—whether by enhancing tax-related technologies, building solutions that streamline complex processes, or contributing to innovative teams at the intersection of tech and public service.</p>
